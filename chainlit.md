# About the Energy Comparison AI Assistant 

Designed by [**Assistant Engineering**](https://assistant.engineering), this tool uses the Chainlit framework to demonstrate a Large Language Model (LLM)&apos;s ability to extract data from a PDF, and then combine that with calls to an Application Programming Interface (API) to create an AI Assistant that acesses energy usage needs.

&nbsp;
**How Does It Work**?
The user uploads a PDF document of their energy bill. The assistant &apos;reads&apos; the energy usage data from that document, alleviating the need for the user to type in their details.

With the user&apos;s input, the assistant will make a call to [The Energy Shop's](https://theenergyshop.com/) price comparison service to return other competitive tariff options based on the data from the PDF. We also provide some custom instructions and tuning prompts for the LLM.

The result is a natural language interface that makes it easy to investigate an energy bill as well as to shop for other affordable tariffs. Contact us at [team@assistant.engineering](mailto:team@assistant.engineering) to learn more. ðŸš€ðŸ¤–
