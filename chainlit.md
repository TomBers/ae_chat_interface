## We Build AI Assistants

AI Assistants will radically reshape the way we work. We're here to help you realise this potential. In fact, we're holding a contest to celebrate our launch where we will design three custom AI Assistants for free.

## Key Components of AI Assistants
- Prompt Development: Structuring text that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model (ref). We have provided a tool to help you implement best practices for building prompts.
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Additional data you provide to your assistant, that the generative AI model can use to provide more specific answers. E.g. your company's policy and training documents.
- Actions (API): This allows the assistant to call out to external services, such as a weather API, integrating live data into the results.
